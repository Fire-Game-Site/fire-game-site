However, to keep the game from lasting more than five seconds, you can build using the spacebar to place down a tower. Make a connected shape with the towers to gain points. You can also gain points by eliminating hostile players. Use points to level up. Level up to gain +’s. Use +’s to give yourself upgraded attributes, including tower health, firing speed, firing range, and player speed. At level twenty you unlock a superpower, which grants you a special perk which is extremely useful in combat situations!"
